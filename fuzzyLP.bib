abstract = {OWA operators have been used in a lot of applications showing the great interest and applicability of these versatile operators. This paper introduces an extension of OWA operators allowing a greater level of flexibility. The new meta notion of OWA operator provides the use of different kind of OWA operators to the same dataset. Different interesting examples have been studied and a sufficient condition in order to ensure the monotonicity of the new flexible operator has been presented.}

In the case of a complete distributive lattice it is shown to agree with a particular case of the discrete Sugeno integral. As an application, we show several ways of aggregating closed intervals by using OWA operators. In a complementary way, the notion of generalized Atanassov's operators is weakened in order to be extended to intervals contained in any lattice. This new approach allows us to build a kind of binary aggregation functions for complete lattices, including OWA operators."

We formulate several guidelines based on HÃ¡jek's methodology in fuzzy logic, which enable us to follow closely the constructions and methods of classical mathematics recast in a fuzzy setting. As a particular solution we propose a three-layer architecture of fuzzy mathematics, with the layers of formal fuzzy logic, a foundational theory, and individual mathematical disciplines developed within its framework. The ground level of logic being sufficiently advanced, we focus on the foundational level; the theory we propose for the foundations of fuzzy mathematics can be characterized as Henkin-style higher-order fuzzy logic. Finally, we give some hints on the further development of individual mathematical disciplines in the proposed framework, and proclaim it a research programme in formal fuzzy mathematics.}

abstract = {The design of district metered areas (DMA) in potable water supply systems is of paramount importance for water utilities to properly manage their systems. Concomitant to their main objective, namely, to deliver quality water to consumers, the benefits include leakage reduction and prompt reaction in cases of natural or malicious contamination events. Given the structure of a water distribution network (WDN), graph theory is the basis for DMA design, and clustering algorithms can be applied to perform the partitioning. However, such sectorization entails a number of network modifications (installing cut-off valves and metering and control devices) involving costs and operation changes, which have to be carefully studied and optimized. Given the complexity of WDNs, optimization is usually performed using metaheuristic algorithms. In turn, optimization may be single or multiple-objective. In this last case, a large number of solutions, frequently integrating the Pareto front, may be produced. The decision maker has eventually to choose one among them, what may be tough task. Multicriteria decision methods may be applied to support this last step of the decision-making process. In this paper, DMA design is addressed by (i) proposing a modified k-means algorithm for partitioning, (ii) using a multiobjective particle swarm optimization to suitably place partitioning devices, (iii) using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to weight the four objective functions considered, and (iv) using technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to rank the Pareto solutions to support the decision. This joint approach is applied in a case of a well-known WDN of the literature, and the results are discussed.}

Therefore, managers object to find best supply chain configuration for their firms. This study proposes a comprehensive configuration for supply chain management process, and it enables to understand relationships among supply chain integration, supply chain strategies, supply chain risk factors, and performance criteria. By reviewing the literature and using experts' knowledge, supply chain configuration criteria are determined. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is employed to consider the interrelations between criteria. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is a suitable tool due to the presence of causalities and relationships among criteria and the difficulty of expressing the interrelations with crisp numbers. It also deals with uncertain and vague data and allows representing hesitation. The application is conducted in an automobile factory, which is one of the largest manufacturers in Turkey. The results show that selection of proper supplier is the most significant supply chain configuration criteria. Thus, the importance of supplier selection criteria is also analyzed as the second phase of the study.},

We present here such an implication for which a so-called unsharp residuated poset can be constructed. Then this implication is connected with the operation meet by the so-called unsharp adjointness. We prove that also conversely, under some additional assumptions, such an unsharp residuated poset can be converted into an orthomodular poset and that this assignment is nearly one-to-one. }

Modifications of so-called quantum structures, in particular orthomodular posets, like pseudo-orthomodular, pseudo-Boolean and Boolean posets are investigated here in order to show that they are operator left residuated or even operator residuated. In fact, they satisfy more general sufficient conditions for operator residuation assumed for bounded posets equipped with a unary operation. It is shown that these conditions may be also necessary if a generalized version using subsets instead of single elements is considered. The above-listed posets can serve as an algebraic semantics for the logic of quantum mechanics in a broad sense. Moreover, our approach shows connections to substructural logics via the considered residuation."

Whilst some measures give results that highly correlate with each other, others give considerably different results. We evaluate all of the current similarity measures on type-2 fuzzy sets to discover which measures have common properties of similarity and, for those that do not, we discuss why the properties are different, demonstrate whether and what effect this has in applications, and discuss how a measure can avoid missing a property that is required. We analyse existing measures in the context of computing with words using a comprehensive collection of data-driven fuzzy sets. Specifically, we highlight and demonstrate how each method performs at clustering words of similar meaning."

For constructing the new interval-valued similarity, interval valued aggregation functions and interval-valued restricted equivalence functions which take into account the width of the intervals are needed, so we firstly study these functions, both in line with the two above stated features. Finally, we provide an illustrative example which makes use of an interval-valued similarity measure in stereo image matching and we show that the results obtained with the proposed interval-valued similarity measures improve numerically (according to the most widely used measures in the literature) the results obtained with interval valued similarity measures which do not consider the width of the intervals."

However, there exist many questions about this research topic which have not been addressed in the literature. One of the most important aims is to formally define a family of fuzzy signatures from which an algebraic structure can be obtained allowing to make computations among fuzzy signatures. This paper studies this family and defines suitable meet and join operators satisfying the properties of a lattice as an algebraic structure. A partial ordering relation, the least and greatest elements are also defined on the family of fuzzy signatures. As a consequence, fuzzy signatures can be used as truth values of fuzzy sets, which provides a great level of representativity, completely different from the interval-valued and type-2 fuzzy sets, among others.}

A signature is a string of data characterizing a certain case (e.g. characteristics of a sentence in case of a document). The place of the individual data is fixed within the string, it holds a local value semantics. Fuzzy granulation is a semantic background technique for all kinds of information which originates from human estimation or recorded by human valuation of numerical data. For analysis of such data the development of special procedures is suggested, different from the usual statistical methods. We used a form of fuzzy signature, called hierarchical document signature to modularize an unstructured document in a hierarchical manner, from Document level to sentence level, sentence level to attribute level and then to word level. We used occurrence of words as the information of the lowest module to find the similarity among the next higher module by aggregating the signature values giving sentence pair coherence.},

abstract={The classical approaches for the traditional problems of text mining, such as document indexing, document clustering or text classification, represent the text as bag-of-words. Words, the units of the representation, are determined by tokenization, using e.g. whitespace and punctuation characters as separator. The bag-of-word based methods face problem with non-segmented text typical for some Asian languages, since the tokenization based solution cannot be applied anymore to determine the representation units. Several solutions were proposed so far, among them frequent max substring mining is adopted here because of its language-independency and favourable speed and store requirements. We present in this paper a fuzzy signature based solution using frequent max substring for non-segmented document representation, and propose how it could be applied for some typical text mining tasks. We show how the flexibility of fuzzy signatures can be exploited for text mining tasks. With the use of this proposed concept, complex decision models in text mining may be constructed more effectively in future.},

This problem is imminent in Budapest (Hungary) in many traditional districts such as the Ferencv{\'a}ros district where we selected a compound area for further examination. By financial aid for the renovation of these buildings which awarded by Municipal Assembly of this district in question there is much uncertainty and confusion concerning how to decide whether or not and how to reconstruct a building where new private owners apply for support. In this paper we propose a formal evaluation method based on fuzzy signature rule bases (the formal being a special case of L-fuzzy object). Using the available expert knowledge we propose a fuzzy signature model including relevance weights and weighted aggregations for each node and parent node, respectively, so that as a result a single membership value may be calculated for each building in question. Linguistic labels for decision (such as worthless, average, highly valuable, etc.) are generated from the values thus obtained. Such linguistic calculations might be of help for the Municipal Assembly awarding financial support. A complete example wit 26 buildings is presented.",

abstract = "It is an significant task to qualify and rank residential buildings based on various priority aspects and to make optimum allocation of the material resources available for the renewal of the buildings.To this end a model based on fuzzy logic was prepared. To construct and to test this model many detailed technical-static expert reports were available all related to a stock of residential buildings in Budapest. Based on this report a database was created. With the help of this database a model was prepared, calculating a so-called status characteristic value between 0 and 1 on the basis of the structures and status of the buildings. For this calculation a fuzzy singleton signature model was prepared. Based on this a hierarchy can be set up related to the stock of buildings, which is suitable for supporting the decision making on intervention. The model was examined by using the created database. Membership values characterising the status of the load-bearing structures-were defined on the basis of the deterioration of the structures. In this chapter a new method for the determination of the membership values is described, which in addition to the deteriorations of the structures takes into account other parameters of the structures, and the impact exerted on the quality of the structure, too. The method is suitable for the determination of the membership values of all primary and secondary structures. As an example the membership values of the foundation structures of the buildings in the database were defined and the results were analysed. The method was elaborated by the use of {"}real fuzzy values{"} (R-fuzzy sets), an extension of the concept of classic fuzzy sets, the former being suitable for simultaneously taking into account various aspects.",

Some of them aim to support a wider range of queries involving fuzzy predicates and this paper focuses on the evaluation of a particular subset of queries, namely those using fuzzy quantified predicates. More precisely, we consider the queries which can be represented by a statement of the type ``Q X are A'' where Q is a fuzzy quantifier, X a set of items of the database and A a fuzzy predicate. The evaluation of this kind of statement is considered according to the propositions of Zadeh, Prade and Yager. We show that Prade and Yager's interpretation of ``Q X are A'', when Q is a monotonous quantifier, are respectively equivalent to a Sugeno and a Choquet fuzzy integral. Thanks to some properties of an $\alpha$-cut and of fuzzy integrals, we are able to show that the evaluation of these queries, according to these three propositions, can be significantly improved with respect to a na{\"i}ve strategy based on the exhaustive scan of set X.",

abstract = "The amount of data that is generated during the execution of a business process is growing. As a consequence it is increasingly hard to extract useful information from the large amount of data that is produced. Linguistic summarization helps to point business analysts in the direction of useful information, by verbalizing interesting patterns that exist in the data. In previous work we showed how linguistic summarization can be used to automatically generate diagnostic statements about event logs, such as âfor most cases that contained the sequence ABC, the throughput time was longâ. However, we also showed that our technique produced too many of these statements to be useful in a practical setting. Therefore this paper presents a novel technique for linguistic summarization of event logs, which generates linguistic summaries that are concise enough to be used in a practical setting, while at the same time enriching the summaries that are produced by also enabling conjunctive statements. The improved technique is based on pruning and clustering of linguistic summaries. We show that it can be used to reduce the number of summary statements 80â100% compared to previous work. In a survey among 51 practitioners, we found that practitioners consider linguistic summarization useful and easy to use and intend to use it if it were commercially available."

A concept which plays an essential role in the treatment of fuzzy quantifiers is that of the cardinality of a fuzzy set. Through the use of this concept, the meaning of a proposition containing one or more fuzzy quantifiers may be represented as a system of elastic constraints whose domain is a collection of fuzzy relations in a relational database. This representation, then, provides a basis for inference from premises which contain fuzzy quantifiers. For example, from the propositions âMost U's are A'sâ and âMost A's are B's,â it follows that âMost2U's are B's,â where most2 is the fuzzy product of the fuzzy proportion most with itself. The computational approach to fuzzy quantifiers which is described in this paper may be viewed as a derivative of fuzzy logic and test-score semantics. In this semantics, the meaning of a semantic entity is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by the entity in question."

In the so-called multi-adjoint logic programming approach, a set of logic rules are assembled with a set of fuzzy connective definitions (whose truth functions are defined as functional rules) for manipulating truth degrees beyond the simpler case of {\{}true,false{\}}. Moreover, we have recently provided optimization techniques by reusing some variants of program transformation techniques based on unfolding which have been largely exploited in the pure functional -not fuzzy- setting for enhancing the behavior of such operators. In this paper we experimentally show the benefits of using the new c-unfolding transformation applied on fuzzy connectives and how to improve the efficiency of the proper unfolding process by reusing the very well-known concept of dependency graph. Moreover, we accompany our technique with cost analysis and discussions on practical aspects.",

In this paper, the usual algebraic operations on real numbers are extended to fuzzy numbers by the use of a fuzzification principle. The practical use of fuzzified operations is shown to be easy, requiring no more computation than when dealing with error intervals in classic tolerance analysis. The field of applications of this approach seems to be large, since it allows many known algorithms to be fitted to fuzzy data. }

The FTP is converted into four transportation problems, which are solved using standard transportation simplex algorithms.

As an application of the operational law, an equivalent form of the expected value operator as well as a theorem for computing the expected value of strictly monotone functions is suggested. Finally, we utilize the operational law to construct a solution framework of fuzzy programming with parameters of regular LR fuzzy numbers, and such type of fuzzy programming problems can be handled by the operational law as the classic deterministic programming without any particular solving techniques."

In particular we consider the complexity of the reachability problem (together with its application in the related satisfiability problem for Horn \{CNF\} formulae) and the computation of transitive closure and transitive reduction of directed hypergraphs (together with its application to the computation of minimum coverings for a set of functional dependencies). Finally a short introduction to the problem of computing shortest hyperpaths in directed hypergraphs is provided. "

For the latter claim, two paradigmatic examples are presented: logic programming with Kleene semantics for modelling reasoning from information in a discourse, to an interpretation of the state of affairs of the intended model, and a neural-symbolic implementation of input/output logic for dealing with uncertainty in dynamic normative contexts.",

In [13], M. Orgun and W.W. Wadge provided a general framework for capturing the semantics of intensional logic programming languages. They demonstrated that if the intensional operators of a language obey some simple semantic properties, then the programs of the language are guaranteed to have a minimum model semantics. One key property involved in the construction of [13] is the monotonicity of intensional operators. In this paper we consider intensional logic programming from a game-theoretic perspective. In particular we define a two-person game and demonstrate that it can be used in order to define a model for any given intensional program of the class introduced in [13]. Moreover, this model is shown to be identical to the minimum model constructed in [13]. More importantly, we demonstrate that the game is even applicable to intensional languages with non-monotonic operators. In this way we provide the first (to our knowledge) general framework for capturing the semantics of non-monotonic intensional logic programming. "

Since the initial proposal by David Poole in 2003, many lifted inference techniques have appeared, by lifting different algorithms or using approximation involving different kinds of models, including parfactor graphs and Markov Logic Networks. Very recently lifted inference was applied to Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the distribution semantics, with proposals such as L P 2 and Weighted First-Order Model Counting (WFOMC). Moreover, techniques for dealing with aggregation parfactors can be directly applied to PLP. In this paper we survey these approaches and present an experimental comparison on five models. The results show that \{WFOMC\} outperforms the other approaches, being able to exploit more symmetries. "

Then, we develop a new tool, called graph-based multi-agent decision making (GMADM) model, to deal with a kind of MCDM problems with the interrelated criteria. In the model, the graphic structure is paid sufficient attention to in two main aspects: (1) how the graphic structure has influence on the benefits of agents (or the criteria values); and (2) the relation between the graphic structure and the importance weights of agents (criteria). In this case, we can select the best plan(s) (or alternative(s)) according to the overall benefits (the overall criteria values) resulting from the model. Moreover, a fuzzy graph-based multi-agent decision making (FGMADM) method is developed to solve a common kind of situations where the graphic structure of agents is uncertain (confidential or false). Three examples are used to illustrate the feasibility of these two developed methods."

In this work, we consider resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from healthy subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in two conditions: eyes-open and eyes-closed. The \{EEGs\} are used to construct functional brain networks in which the nodes are \{EEG\} sensor locations and edges represent functional connectivity between them. The networks are then tested for a number of neurobiologically relevant graph theory metrics. The analyses show that the network properties are stable across all conventional frequency bands. \{AD\} brains in eyes-closed condition show significantly reduced local efficiency and modularity measures (P &lt; 0.05; Wilcoxon's ranksum test). We then use the network metrics as features for discriminating \{AD\} from healthy controls. Three feature selection methods (Genetic Algorithms (GA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and Social Impact Theory based Optimization (SITO)) are used to select the best feature set. \{GA\} with support vector machines (as classifier) results in an accuracy of 83\% in eyes-close beta band. The set of optimal features include edge betweenness centrality, global efficiency, modularity and synchronizability. "

These operators consider linguistic term set ordering, constraints that are the counterpart of properties fulfilled by triangular norms in fuzzy logic, and additional restrictions created by the expert's procedure to combining certainty. The method avoids the usual problems that arise in other treatments of certainty linguistic terms, where they are represented as fuzzy numbers or fuzzy truth labels. One of the most significant problems is the lack of consensus in the representation of each term by a group of experts, due to the necessity of representing the terms in a pseudonumerical scale.<>},

This paper considers the existent results on residual implication induced by fuzzy conjunctions to introduce the concept of residual implication derived from overlap functions O, denoted by RO-implication, preserving the residuation property. RO-implications are weaker than R-implications constructed from positive and continuous t-norms, in the sense that RO-implications do not necessarily satisfy certain properties satisfied by such R-implications, as the exchange principle, but only weaker versions of these properties. However, in general, such properties are not demanded for many applications. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to analyse the main properties satisfied by RO-implications, establishing under which conditions of an overlap function O the derived RO-implication satisfies the properties of fuzzy implications and (b) to provide two particular characterization of RO-implications derived from (i) the sub-class of overlap functions O that have 1 as neutral element and (ii) the more general sub-class of overlap functions O satisfying the condition O(x,1)â©½x."

abstract = "Recently, Vemuri and Jayaram (2012) have proposed a novel generating method of fuzzy implications, called the â-composition. Further, they have also proposed Mutual Exchangeability (ME), a generalization of the Exchange Principle (EP) to a pair of fuzzy implications and have shown that (ME) plays a central role in the preservation of basic properties, functional equations and families of fuzzy implications w.r.t. the â-composition (Vemuri and Jayaram, 2014). Due to the important role played by (ME), in this work, we investigate the pairs (I,J) of fuzzy implications that satisfy (ME). Towards this, we show first that there exist pairs (I,J) of fuzzy implications that satisfy (ME) and determine some necessary conditions on such fuzzy implications. Following this, for a given IâI, we find the set JI of all fuzzy implications J such that the pair (I,J) satisfies (ME). Keeping in view the variety of fuzzy implications and the complexity of the functional equation (ME), we restrict our investigations to four important families of fuzzy implications, namely, (S,N)-, R-, f- and g-implications. Further, we discuss a generalization of the Cauchy multiplicative equation, whose solutions help us in obtaining the set JI for some families of fuzzy implications."

Even when contraposition is not satisfied, there exist some methods for modifying an implication function with the aim that the new implication satisfies this property, these methods are known as contrapositivisations. In this paper some new methods of contrapositivisation with respect to any fuzzy negation are presented and the properties preserved by these new methods are studied. Along this study we will see that these new methods not only preserve the usual properties preserved by the already known methods, but they also have some additional properties."

The axiomatization and localization for residuated skew lattices are obtained. Moreover, a characterization of residuation on skew lattices via adjointness is presented. Meanwhile, three special subvarieties: distributive residuated skew lattices, skew MTL-algebras and skew BL-algebras, are investigated. In particular, we show that every skew Heyting algebra is a reduct of a special residuated skew lattice."

In this paper, we continue studying this topic and discuss the four basic distributive laws of fuzzy implications over overlap and grouping functions. At first, we investigate the four basic distributive laws of fuzzy implications over overlap and grouping functions for the residual implications derived from overlap functions, (G, N)-implications obtained from grouping functions G and fuzzy negations N, and QL-operations derived from overlap functions, grouping functions and fuzzy negations, respectively. And then, we extend the related results when we take into account the residual implications, (G, N)-implications or QL-operations in the four basic distributive laws of fuzzy implications over overlap and grouping functions to arbitrary fuzzy implications satisfying some desirable algebraic properties in the preceding four basic distributive laws."

abstract = "Overlap and grouping functions are special kinds of non necessarily associative aggregation operators proposed for many applications, mainly when the associativity property is not strongly required. The classes of overlap and grouping functions are richer than the classes of t-norms and t-conorms, respectively, concerning some properties like idempotency, homogeneity, and, mainly, the self-closedness feature with respect to the convex sum and the aggregation by generalized composition of overlap/grouping functions. In previous works, we introduced some classes of fuzzy implications derived by overlap and/or grouping functions, namely, the residual implications RO-implications, the strong implications (G,N)-implications and the Quantum Logic implications QL-implications, for overlap functions O, grouping functions G and fuzzy negations N. Such implications do not necessarily satisfy certain properties, but only weaker versions of these properties, e.g., the exchange principle. However, in general, such properties are not demanded for many applications. In this paper, we analyze the so-called law of O-Conditionality, O(x,I(x,y))â¤y, for any fuzzy implication I and overlap function O, and, in particular, for RO-implications, (G,N)-implications, QL-implications and D-implications derived from tuples (O,G,N), the latter also introduced in this paper. We also study the conditional antecedent boundary condition for such fuzzy implications, since we prove that this property, associated to the left ordering property, is important for the analysis of the O-Conditionality. We show that the use of overlap functions to implement de generalized Modus Ponens, as the scheme enabled by the law of O-Conditionality, provides more generality than the laws of T-conditionality and U-conditionality, for t-norms T and uninorms U, respectively."

abstract = {We study the multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems in which the attribute values provided by the decision makers take the form of intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic (ITrFL) information considering the uncertainty and inaccuracy of input arguments. Some new aggregation operators called intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic weighted average (ITrFLWA), intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (ITrFLOWA) and intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic hybrid weighted average (ITrFLHWA) operators are proposed at first. Then, we study some desirable properties of the proposed operators, such as monotonicity, idempotency, commutativity and boundedness. Next, two novel approaches based on the proposed operators are developed to solve MAGDM problems with intuitionistic trapezoid fuzzy linguistic information. Finally, an illustrative example of emergency logistics supplier selection is provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Variable threshold concept lattice (VTCL) was proposed by Ma et al.(2006), which provide a new parameterized way to obtain formal concepts from data with fuzzy attributes. Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) algebras were proposed by Liu (1998), which are new semantic methodology relating to the fuzzy theory. In this paper, in order to explore the relationship between the AFS algebras and VTCL, three algebra homomorphism maps are established, by which one can find that AFS algebras have similar properties to VTCL.},

In order to fill the inadequacies, this paper put forwards a new method to aggregate the evaluation information of university teachers. The new method involves many different parts of the evaluation. First, a new information aggregation method--TDW operator method is presented; then TOPSIS is employed to handle evaluation results of different types of evaluation subjects in order to avoid the difficulty of information aggregation preference of different types; third, method to determine density weighted vector according to the relevant degree of different information is introduced. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness.},

First of all, a level empowerment system is established to generate the weight of each surveyed tourist. Then, some new linguistic operations are defined which can remedy the defects of the existed operations. Besides, the expectation and variance in linguistic information environment are defined to generate the weight of each character of tourist and the weights of indicators, and linguistic weighted arithmetic average (LWAA) operator is introduced to aggregate the linguistic information of each tourist and the group linguistic information of each indicator. Finally, a satisfaction evaluation case is illustrated to explain the evaluation process.},

abstract = {Fuzzy logic has shown to be a suitable framework to handle contradictions in which, unsurprisingly, the notion of inconsistency can be defined in different ways. This paper starts with a short survey of different ways to define the notion of inconsistency in fuzzy logic systems. As a result, we provide a first notion of inconsistency by means of the absence of models. Subsequently, we define two measures of consistency that belong purely to the fuzzy paradigm; in the sense that both measures coincide with the crisp notion of consistency when the set of truth values is {0,â1}. Accordingly, we can state that the two provided measures of consistence are notions of consistence based on degrees, bringing back the spirit of fuzzy logic into the notion of consistency.}

abstract = {Interval-valued fuzzy sets are an extension of fuzzy sets and are helpful when there is not enough information to define a membership function. This paper studies the behavior of a construction method for an interval-valued fuzzy relation built from a fuzzy relation. The behavior of this construction method is analyzed depending on the used t-norms and t-conorms, showing that different combinations of them produce a big variation in the results. Furthermore, a hybrid construction method that considers weight functions and a smoothing procedure is also introduced. Among the different applications of this method, the detection of edges in images is one of the most challenging. Thus, the performance of the proposal in detecting image edges is tested, showing that the hybrid approach that combines weights and a smoothing procedure provides better results than the non-weighted methods.

abstract = {This paper introduces a logical characterization of multi-adjoint algebras with a twofold contribution. On the one hand, the study of multi-adjoint algebras, from a logical perspective, will allow us to discover both the core and new features of these algebras. On the other hand, the axiomatization of multi-adjoint algebras will be useful to take advantage of the properties of the logical connectives considered in the corresponding deductive system. The mechanism considered to carry out the mentioned axiomatization follows the one given by Petr Hájek for residuated lattices. Specifically, the paper presents the bounded poset logic (BPL) as an axiomatization of a bounded poset, since this algebraic structure is the most simple structure from which a multi-adjoint algebra is defined. In the following, the language of BPL is enriched with a family of pairs, composed of a conjunctor and an implication, and its axiomatic system is endowed with new axioms, giving rise to the multi-adjoint logic (ML). The soundness and completeness of BPL and ML are proven. Finally, a comparison between the axiomatization of the multi-adjoint logic and the one given for the BL logic is introduced.}

ABSTRACT = {In Bitcoin, if a miner is able to solve a computationally hard problem called proof of work, it will receive an amount of bitcoin as a reward which is the sum of the fees for the transactions included in a block plus an amount inversely proportional to the number of blocks discovered so far. At the moment of writing, the block reward is several orders of magnitude greater than the sum of transaction fees. Usually, miners try to collect the largest reward by including transactions associated with high fees. The main purpose of transaction fees is to prevent network spamming. However, they are also used to prioritize transactions. In order to use the minimum amount of fees, users usually have to find a compromise between fees and urgency of a transaction. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic logic model to experimentally analyze how fees affect confirmation time and miner&rsquo;s revenue and to predict if an increase of average fees will generate a situation when the miner gets more reward by not following the protocol.},

abstract = "The development of enterprise software typically relies on object-oriented (OO) programming languages. However, OO languages are not particularly suited for the implementation of software which involves solving complicated search problems with dynamically appearing constraints, e.Â g. as found in logistics. Aiming to improve this situation, we propose the MÃ¼nster Logic-imperative Language (Muli). As a constraint-logic OO language, it facilitates an integrated implementation of applications that use aspects from both constraint-logic and object-oriented programming, thus eliminating the need to resort to JNI for the integration of search applications that are written in a (constraint) logic language. Muli extends Java by logic variables and encapsulated search. Its runtime is based on a symbolic Java virtual machine and leverages constraint solvers. Outside of search regions, Muli behaves just like Java. We motivate the benefits of integrating object-oriented programming and constraint-logic programming into a single language and introduce novel concepts that are required for a seamless integration. Furthermore, we present an operational semantics and transfer concepts and semantics into implementations of a compiler and a virtual machine."

By fast growth of the semantic web and also, the variety of its applications, ontology mapping (ontology alignment) has been transformed into a crucial issue in the realm of computer science. Several approaches are introduced for ontology alignment during these last years, but developing more accurate and efficient algorithms and finding new effective techniques and algorithms for this problem is an interesting research area since real-world applications with respect to their more complicated concepts need more efficient algorithms. In this paper, we illustrated a new ontology mapping method based on learning using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), and show how the ILP can be used to solve the ontology mapping problem. As a matter of fact, in this approach, an ontology which is described in OWL format is interpreted to first-order logic. Then, with the use of learning based on inductive logic, the existing hidden rules and relationships between concepts are discovered and presented. Since the inductive logic has high flexibility in solving problems such as discovering relationships between concepts and links, it also can be performed effectively in solving the ontology alignment problem. Our experimental results show that this technique yield to more accurate results comparing to other matching algorithms and systems, achieving an F-measure of 95.6\% and 91\% on two well-known reference datasets the Anatomy and the Library, respectively."

We show that each finite theory consisting of formulas of FAL can be represented by a definite program so that the semantic entailment in FAL can be characterized by correct answers for the program. Conversely, we show that for each definite program there is a collection of formulas of FAL so that the correct answers can be represented by the entailment in FAL. Using the link, we can transport results from FAL to FLP and vice versa which gives us, e.g., a syntactic characterization of correct answers based on Pavelka-style Armstrong-like axiomatization of FAL. We further show that entailment in FLP is reducible to reasoning with Boolean attribute implications and elaborate on related issues including properties of least models."

In this setting, pessimistic and optimistic decision criteria have been formally justified. This approach has been transposed into possibilistic logic in which the available knowledge is described by formulas which are more or less certainly true and the goals are described in a separate prioritized base. This paper adapts the possibilistic logic handling of qualitative decision making under uncertainty in the Answer Set Programming (ASP) setting. We show how weighted beliefs and prioritized preferences belonging to two separate knowledge bases can be handled in ASP by modeling qualitative decision making in terms of abductive logic programming where (uncertain) knowledge about the world and prioritized preferences are encoded as possibilistic definite logic programs and possibilistic literals respectively. We provide ASP-based and possibilistic ASP-based algorithms for calculating optimal decisions and utility values according to the possibilistic decision criteria. We describe a prototype implementing the algorithms proposed on top of different ASP solvers and we discuss the complexity of the different implementations."

This mechanism will allow us to establish technical properties relating the different stable models of both logic programming frameworks. Moreover, it makes possible that the already developed and future theory associated with stable models of multi-adjoint normal logic programs can be applied to extended multi-adjoint logic programs.}

We extend the concept of the Herbrand base of a logic program to consist of all positive clauses that may be formed using the atoms in the Herbrand base. A monotonic closure operator is defined, operating on the lattice formed by the power set of the extended Herbrand base. The closure operator is shown to achieve a least fixpoint which captures the intended meaning of derivability of disjunctive programs. The equivalence of the fixpoint semantics with the minimal model semantics is also shown. We provide a characterization for Minker's generalized closed-world assumption using the fixpoint operator. We introduce the concept of support for negation and develop a proof procedure for handling negation based on this concept. We describe a proof procedure based on SLINF derivation, a modification of SLI derivation (LUST resolution). We show that the proof procedure reduces to SLDNF resolution when applied to Horn programs."

abstract="Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-known problem solving approach based on nonmonotonic logic programs. hex-programs extend ASP with external atoms for accessing arbitrary external information. In this paper we study inconsistent ASP- and hex-programs, i.e.,Â programs which do not possess answer sets, and introduce a novel notion of inconsistency reasons for characterizing their inconsistency depending on the input facts. This problem is mainly motivated by upcoming applications for optimizations of the evaluation algorithms for hex-programs. Further applications can be found in ASP debugging. We then analyze the complexity of reasoning problems related to the computation of such inconsistency reasons. Finally, we present a meta-programming encoding in disjunctive ASP which computes inconsistency reasons for given normal logic programs, and a basic procedural algorithm for computing inconsistency reasons for general hex-programs.",

abstract = "We consider probabilistic logic programs (PLPs) for non-extreme distributions. We show that in the relational case with fixed populations, PLPs cannot represent many non-extreme distributions, even using negations. We introduce negative rule probabilities in PLPs, and show they make the language strictly more expressive. In addition, they render negations unnecessary: negations in PLPs can be translated to rules with negative probabilities, thus avoiding the problem of logical inconsistency. Furthermore, this translation keeps the PLP size compact (assuming the number of negations per rule is small). This translation algorithm also allows algorithms for exact inference that do not support negations to be applicable to PLPs with negations. The noise probabilities for non-exclusive rules are difficult to interpret and unintuitive to manipulate. To alleviate this we define âprobability-strengthsâ, an alternative representation for probabilistic values, which results in an intuitive additive algebra for combining rules. For acyclic propositional PLPs we prove what constraints on the strengths allow for proper distributions on the non-noise variables and allow for all non-extreme distributions to be represented. We show how arbitrary CPDs can be converted into this form in a canonical way."

abstract = "Answer set programming is a form of declarative programming that can be used to elegantly model various systems. When the available knowledge about these systems is imperfect, however, the resulting programs can be inconsistent. In such cases, it is of interest to find plausible repairs, i.e. plausible modifications to the original program that ensure the existence of at least one answer set. Although several approaches to this end have already been proposed, most of them merely find a repair which is in some sense minimal. In many applications, however, expert knowledge is available which could allow us to identify better repairs. In particular, we consider the scenario where this expert knowledge is formulated as rules of thumb, but no training data is available to learn how these rules of thumb interact. The main question we address in this paper is whether we can then still aggregate the rules of thumb in a useful way. In addition to standard aggregation techniques, we present a novel statistical approach that assigns weights to these rules of thumb, by sampling, in a particular way, from a pool of possible repairs. In particular, we evaluate how frequently each given rule of thumb is violated in the sample of repairs, and use the Z-score of this distribution to set the weight of that rule. We analyze the potential of using expert knowledge in this way, by focusing on a specific case study: Gene Regulatory Networks. We describe the rules of thumb that express available expert knowledge from the biological literature and explain how they can be encoded while repairing inconsistencies. Finally, we experimentally compare the proposed repair strategies using rules of thumb against the baseline strategy of identifying minimal repairs."

pages="159--184",
abstract="It is well-known that knowledgebases may contain inconsistencies. We provide a measure to quantify the inconsistency of a knowledgebase, thereby allowing for the comparison of the inconsistency of various knowledgebases, represented as first-order logic formulas. We use quasi-classical (QC) logic for this purpose. QC logic is a formalism for reasoning and analysing inconsistent information. It has been used as the basis of a framework for measuring inconsistency in propositional theories. Here we extend this framework, by using a first-order logic version of QC logic for measuring inconsistency in first-order theories. We motivate the QC logic approach by considering some formulae as database or knowledgebase integrity constraints. We then define a measure of extrinsic inconsistency that can be used to compare the inconsistency of different knowledgebases. This measure takes into account both the language used and the underlying domain. We show why this definition also captures the intrinsic inconsistency of a knowledgebase. We also provide a formalization of paraconsistent equality, called quasi-equality, and we use this in an extended example of an application for measuring inconsistency between heterogeneous sources of information and integrity constraints prior to merging.",

abstract="An important limitation of traditional logic programming as a knowledge representation tool, in comparison with classical logic, is that logic programming does not allow us to deal directly with incomplete information. In order to overcome this limitation, we extend the class of general logic programs by including classical negation, in addition to negation-as-failure. The semantics of such extended programs is based on the method of stable models. The concept of a disjunctive database can be extended in a similar way. We show that some facts of commonsense knowledge can be represented by logic programs and disjunctive databases more easily when classical negation is available. Computationally, classical negation can be eliminated from extended programs by a simple preprocessor. Extended programs are identical to a special case of default theories in the sense of Reiter.",

We present the fuzzy answer set semantics for the extended fuzzy logic programs, which is based on the classical answer set semantics of classical extended logic programs [7]. We show that the proposed semantics is a natural extension to the classical answer set semantics of classical extended logic programs [7]. Furthermore, we define fixpoint semantics for extended fuzzy logic programs with and without non-monotonic negation, and study their relationship to the fuzzy answer set semantics. In addition, we show that the fuzzy answer set semantics is reduced to the stable fuzzy model semantics for normal fuzzy logic programs introduced in [42]. The importance of that is computational methods developed for normal fuzzy logic programs can be applied to the extended fuzzy logic programs. Moreover, we show that extended fuzzy logic programs can be intuitively used for representing and reasoning about actions in fuzzy environment.",

From a different perspective, it is a generalization of tightly integrated disjunctive dl-programs by fuzzy vagueness in both the description logic and the logic program component. We show that the new formalism faithfully extends both fuzzy disjunctive programs and fuzzy description logics, and that under suitable assumptions, reasoning in the new formalism is decidable. Furthermore, we present a polynomial reduction of certain fuzzy dl-programs to tightly integrated disjunctive dl-programs. We also provide a special case of fuzzy dl-programs for which deciding consistency andÂ query processing have both a polynomial data complexity.",

When the involved negation is the natural negation of a fuzzy implication function, the NC principle becomes specially important because then it is a necessary condition for the fulfillment of the Modus Ponens inequality, as well as for the residuation property for residuated implications. In this paper, the functional equation corresponding to the NC principle is deeply studied in the case when both, the aggregation function and the fuzzy negation, are as general as possible. Moreover, the results are applied to the case when the fuzzy negation is the natural negation of a fuzzy implication function, extending this study to the most usual classes of fuzzy implication functions."

abstract={Admissible orders have brought the structure of chains in the framework of interval-valued fuzzy sets. However, a deeper study of functions monotone with respect to admissible orders is still missing in the literature. In this work, we consider the construction of negations and strong negations on intervals with respect to admissible orders, in particular, for the Xu and Yager and lexicographical orders, as well as for those based on K?operators. We introduce and discuss an approach to the construction of strong negations on intervals with respect to K?,?orders based on an arbitrary couple of strong negations defined over the standard real interval [0, 1]. The introduced strong negations have a deep impact on all fields exploiting fuzzy methods dealing with intervals, allowing to introduce complements, dual aggregations, implications, entropies, etc.},

Both have been intensively investigated since the early 1980s, revealing a tight relationship between them. However, the main results regarding this relationship, published by Fodor and Demirli DeBaets in the 1990s, have been poorly disseminated and are nowadays somewhat obsolete due to the subsequent advances in the field. The present paper deals with the translation of the classical logical equivalence p â q â¡ Â¬pâ¨q, often called material implication, to the fuzzy framework, which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between implication functions and disjunctors (the class of aggregation functions that extend the Boolean disjunction to the unit interval). The construction of implication functions from disjunctors via negation functions, and vice versa, is reviewed, stressing the properties of disjunctors (respectively, implication functions) that ensure certain properties of implication functions (disjunctors)."

In this article, we discuss different types of dual fuzzy rough set models which all consider fuzzy coverings. In particular, we study two models using non-nested level-based representation of fuzziness. In addition to the study of the theoretical properties for each model, interrelationships between the different models are discussed, resulting in a Hasse diagram of fuzzy covering-based rough set models for a finite fuzzy covering, an IMTL-t-norm and its residual implicator."

We apply Datalog W as the basis to give a uniform semantics to a weighted extension of the \{RT\} language family, called \{RT\} W . Moreover, we show that we can model the deduction and abduction reasoning with semiring-based soft constraints: deduction can validate or not the access request, while abduction can be used to compute the missing credentials if the access is denied and the level of preference that would grant the access.

title={Extending the Contraposition Property of Propositional Logic for Fuzzy Abduction},
year={2013},
volume={21},

abstract={Abduction deals with assumption-based reasoning to explain an observation. In the context of fuzzy reasoning, abduction attempts to determine the membership function of the fuzzy propositions present in the antecedent of a rule when the membership functions for the propositions in the consequent of the rule are given. Currently available models of fuzzy abduction are capable of inferring the membership function of the antecedent clause accurately when the antecedent includes single fuzzy proposition. However, when the antecedent clause of a rule contains multiple fuzzy propositions, these models fail to determine the independent membership function of the individual propositions present in the antecedent. This paper presents a new formulation to handle the above problem by fuzzy extension of the well-known contraposition property of propositional logic. Several interesting properties due to the fuzzy extension of the classical contraposition have been derived. An algorithm for automated abduction using the extended contraposition property has been developed to demonstrate the principle of abduction with rules containing one or more fuzzy propositions in the antecedent/consequent. The time complexity of the proposed fuzzy abduction for a sequence of n-chained rules, where each rule has m fuzzy propositions, is O (mn), considering a uniform cost for composition operation and t-norm computation of the antecedent.},

abstract = "Abstract Abduction (???????, in ancient Greek, often translated as âleading awayâ or âreductionâ) is a procedure in which something that lacks classical explanatory epistemic virtue can be accepted because it has virtue of another kind: Gabbay and Woods [15] contend (GW-schema) that abduction presents an ignorance-preserving or (ignorance-mitigating) character. From this perspective abductive reasoning is a response to an ignorance-problem; through abduction the basic ignorance â that does not have to be considered a total âignoranceâ â is neither solved nor left intact. Abductive reasoning is an ignorance-preserving accommodation of the problem at hand. Is abduction really ignorance-preserving? To better answer this question I will introduce (and take advantage of) an eco-cognitive model (EC-Model) of abduction. It will be illustrated that through abduction, knowledge can be enhanced, even when abduction is not considered an inference to the best explanation in the classical sense of the expression, that is an inference necessarily characterized by an empirical evaluation phase, or an inductive phase, as Peirce called it. To further deepen the eco-cognitive character of abduction a simple genealogy of logic is provided: Aristotle clearly states that in syllogistic theory local/environmental cognitive factors â external to that peculiar inferential process, for example regarding users/reasoners, are given up. Indeed, to define syllogism Aristotle first of all insists that all syllogisms are valid and contends that the necessity of this kind of reasoning is related to the circumstance that âno further term from outside (á¼Î¾ÏÎ¸ÉÎ½) is neededâ, in sum syllogism is the fruit of a kind of eco-cognitive immunization. At the same time Aristotle presents a seminal perspective on abduction: the second part of the article considers the famous passage in Chapter \{B25\} of Prior Analytics concerning á¼ÏÎ±Î³ÏÎ³Î® (âleading awayâ), also studied by Peirce. I contend that some of the current well-known distinctive characters of abductive cognition are already expressed, which are in tune with the EC-Model. By providing an illustration of the role of the method of analysis and of the middle terms in Plato's dialectic argumentation, considered as related to the diorismic/poristic process in ancient geometry â also, later on, emphasized by Proclus â I maintain that it is just this intellectual heritage which informs Aristotle' Chapter \{B25\} on á¼ÏÎ±Î³ÏÎ³Î®. Even if, in general, Aristotle seems to sterilize, thanks to the invention of syllogistic theory, every âdialecticâ background of reasoning, nevertheless in Chapter \{B25\} he is still pointing to the fundamental inferential role in reasoning of those externalities that substantiate the process of âleading awayâ (á¼ÏÎ±Î³ÏÎ³Î®). Hence, we can gain a new positive perspective about the âconstitutiveâ eco-cognitive character of abduction, just thanks to Aristotle himself. Finally, the paper presents an excursus on Aristotle's enthymemes from signs, disregarded by Peirce, but extremely important to stress the Aristotelian treatment of what I have called selective abduction. A forthcoming companion paper [35] will further deepen the EC-Model of abduction stressing stricter logical aspects: the first result will be that, contrarily to the classical logical view, relevance and plausibility in abductive reasoning have to be relativized and so the epistemologically embarrassing concepts of irrelevance and implausibility exculpated: they are not always offensive to reason.

abstract={An approach to automated deduction under uncertainty, based on possibilistic logic, is described; for that purpose we deal with clauses weighted by a degree that is a lower bound of a necessity or a possibility measure, according to the nature of the uncertainty. Two resolution rules are used for coping with the different situations, and the classical refutation method can be generalized with these rules. Also, the lower bounds are allowed to be functions of variables involved in the clauses, which results in hypothetical reasoning capabilities. In cases where only lower bounds of necessity measures are involved, a semantics is proposed in which the completeness of the extended resolution principle is proved. The relation between our approach and the idea of minimizing abnormality is briefly discussed. Moreover, deduction from a partially inconsistent knowledge base can be managed in this approach and captures a form of nonmonotonicity},

 abstract = {Possibilistic Defeasible Logic Programming (PDeLP) is a logic programming language which combines features from argumentation theory and logic programming, incorporating the treatment of possibilistic uncertainty at the object-language level. In spite of its expressive power, an important limitation in PDeLP is that imprecise, fuzzy information cannot be expressed in the object language. One interesting alternative for solving this limitation is the use of PGL$^+$, a Possibilistic logic over G{\"o}del logic extended with fuzzy constants. Fuzzy constants in PGL$^+$ allow expressing disjunctive information about the unknown value of a variable, in the sense of a magnitude, modeled as a (unary) predicate. The aim of this article is twofold: firstly, we formalize DeGLP$^+$, a possibilistic defeasible logic programming language that extends PDeLP through the use of PGL$^+$ in order to incorporate fuzzy constants and a fuzzy unification mechanism for them. Secondly, we propose a way to handle conflicting arguments in the context of the extended framework.},

abstract = "Fuzzy arithmetic operations are applied to mathematical equations that include fuzzy numbers, which are commonly used to represent non-probabilistic uncertainty in different applications. Although there are two mathematical approaches available in the literature for implementing fuzzy arithmetic (i.e., the Î±-cut approach, and the extension principle approach), the existing computational methods are mainly focused on implementing the Î±-cut approach due to its simplicity. However, this approach causes overestimation of uncertainty in the resulting fuzzy numbers, a phenomenon that reduces the interpretability of the results. This overestimation can be reduced by implementing fuzzy arithmetic using the extension principle; however, existing computational methods for implementing the extension principle approach are limited to the use of min and drastic product t-norms. Using the min t-norm produces the same result as the Î±-cuts and interval calculations approach, and the drastic product t-norm is criticized for producing resulting fuzzy numbers that are highly sensitive to the changes in the input fuzzy numbers. This paper presents original computational methods for implementing fuzzy arithmetic operations on triangular fuzzy numbers using the extension principle approach with product and Lukasiewicz t-norms. These computational methods contribute to the different applications of fuzzy arithmetic; they reduce the overestimation of uncertainty, as compared to the Î±-cut approach, and they reduce the sensitivity of the resulting fuzzy numbers to changes in the input fuzzy numbers, as compared to the extension principle approach using drastic product t-norm."

Also, we define an immediate consequence operator that allows us to give a fixpoint characterization of the least Herbrand model for a FASILL program. A remarkable aspect of our declarative and fixpoint semantics is the fact that both have been enriched with the use of thresholds thanks to the natural ability of the underlying fuzzy language for managing such constructs. Moreover, we have connected both semantics with an operational one, which also manages thresholds in an efficient way, by proving the correctness of the whole semantic framework."

abstract = { In âmulti-adjoint logic programmingâ, MALP in brief, each fuzzy logic program is associated with its own âmulti-adjoint latticeâ for modelling truth degrees beyond the simpler case of true and false, where a large set of fuzzy connectives can be defined. On this wide repertoire, it is crucial to connect each implication symbol with a proper conjunction thus conforming constructs of the form (âi, \&i) called âadjoint pairsâ, whose use directly affects both declarative and operational semantics of the MALP framework. In this work, we firstly show how the strong dependence of adjoint pairs can be largely weakened for an interesting âsub-classâ of MALP programs. Then, we reason in a similar way till conceiving a âsuper-classâ of fuzzy logic programs beyond MALP, which definitively drops out the need for using adjoint pairs, since the new semantics behaviour relies on much more relaxed lattices than multi-adjoint ones. }

On the other hand, the usefulness of coalgebra theory has been increasing in the recent years, and its importance is undeniable. In this paper, somehow mimicking the use of universal algebra, we define a new kind of coalgebras (the ND-coalgebras) that allows to formalize non-determinism, and show that several concepts, widely used in computer science are, indeed, ND-coalgebras. Within this formal context, we study a minimal set of properties which provides a coalgebraic definition of multilattices. "
